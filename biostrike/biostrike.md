Biostrike: open source antibiotic discovery
 "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" (White Rabbit) (1)
In the following, a R&D scenario dubbed ‘Biostrike’ is presented. It was developed by the citizens during the Bio-Commons workshop, addressing technological and managerial innovations to mitigate the antibiotic-resistance-crisis. The aspiration of the citizens was to highlight the problem of the post-antibiotic era, but also to offer practical solutions. Biostrike was started as a science-art based educational project. It was chosen to be developed further into a lighthouse project for the Bio-Commons and to address the technical, social and legal questions around the Bio-Commons. In a citizen science project, people around the globe could contribute to the solution of the antibiotics problem by identifying new antibiotics in a crowd-sourced research approach. Decentralizing the screening for antibiotics around the world could on one hand reduce the costs of research as more people would contribute voluntarily and on the other hand increase the chances to discover new compounds, as citizens of a diverse range of countries have direct access to a wide variety of ecosystems and local knowledge around the globe. The Biostrike project would ideally be aligned with related international projects such as the Indian initiative “open source drug discovery” (2), private initiatives such as open-source pharma (3) and others (4),(5), the European commission projects(6),(7) e.g. SYNMOD (8) or combact (9),(10) and international projects lead be the WHO (11).
